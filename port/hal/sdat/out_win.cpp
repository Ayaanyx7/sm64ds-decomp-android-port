// Audio output: winmm waveOut, loaded dynamically.
//
// Dynamic loading follows walk_window's rule for user32/gdi32 -- resolve the
// library only after ntr::io_init has reserved the fixed DS regions, so the
// loader cannot place a DLL at 0x04000000..0x07ffffff and take an address
// the game needs. sd_out_open is reached from the first hosted ARM7 tick,
// which is well after io_init.
//
// A ring of four 1024-frame headers is 125 ms at 32768 Hz. The device is
// asked for 32768 Hz first (the DS's own mixing rate, so no resampling); if
// it refuses, 48000 Hz with linear interpolation at the output stage.
//
// SM64DS_NO_AUDIO=1 skips the device entirely. The mixer and sequencer still
// run -- clocked off the video frame instead of the device -- so a WAV dump
// and every "did that command do anything" check still work.
//
// THE DEVICE OPENS ON A WORKER THREAD (run perf2, lane AUDIOBOOT). On some
// machines winmm takes seconds to answer its first call: on the box this was
// measured on, waveOutGetNumDevs took 13.4 s and waveOutOpen 7 to 17 s, while
// every later call (prepare, write, reset) took under a millisecond. The open
// used to run on the main thread at the first sound push, so the window sat
// on its first picture for ~25 s before the title appeared. Now the first
// push starts the open on a worker, gives it OPEN_GRACE_MS (a normal device
// is live by then and the run is exactly the old one), and returns.
//
// WHILE THE WORKER WAITS, A VIRTUAL DEVICE DRAINS THE RING. It is the same
// NBUF x OUT_FRAMES ring, refilled by the same loop, and each block counts as
// played when the real clock says a device at SD_MIX_RATE would have finished
// it -- exactly how waveOut hands a header back. So the mixer and the 192 Hz
// sequencer clock advance at the pace a device that opened instantly would
// have driven them, and not at the no-device clock's 546 frames a push, which
// in a course (30 pushes a second) would have run the music at half speed and
// brought it up late. Nothing reaches the speaker in that window: the player
// hears silence until the device exists, and nothing more is lost than that.
//
// THE HAND-OVER renders nothing. The blocks the virtual device still has in
// flight at that instant are prepared and written to the real device in the
// order they were queued, the oldest from the frame the virtual device has
// reached, so the speaker starts where an instant device would be; then the
// ordinary refill runs for the headers the virtual device had already
// finished -- the same work that push would have done with a device all
// along. No block is rendered twice and none is skipped, so the tick count
// and the sequence state carry straight across. (A device that refuses
// 32768 Hz and opens at 48000 cannot play blocks rendered at 32768: those in
// flight at the hand-over are dropped, at most 125 ms nobody heard.)
//
// TEST KNOBS, all off by default:
//   SM64DS_AUDIO_OPEN_DELAY_MS=<n>  the worker sleeps n ms before it starts, to
//                                   force the hand-over mid-level on a machine
//                                   whose device opens fast.
//   SM64DS_AUDIO_OPEN_SYNC=1        the old shape: the first push blocks until
//                                   the device answers (the "instant device"
//                                   side of an A/B, on one binary).
//   SM64DS_AUDIO_BOOT_TRACE=<path>  one line per push: mode, frames rendered,
//                                   the running total, the 192 Hz tick count
//                                   that total implies, the blocks written.
//   SM64DS_AUDIO_DEV_DUMP=<path>    every block exactly as handed to
//                                   waveOutWrite, raw 16-bit stereo, in order.
//   SM64DS_AUDIO_DEV_SILENT=1       each block is zeroed after that record and
//                                   before the write, so a proof run can mix
//                                   at full volume and still play nothing.
